##  Correlation Analysis 
Features with Correlations Below 0.8:
STD_mean: Has very weak correlations (close to 0) with all other features.
EMA200_mean: Correlations with MACD_mean, Stochastic_mean, and Force_mean are less than 0.8.
EMA100_mean: Correlations with MACD_mean, Stochastic_mean, and Force_mean are less than 0.8.
EMA50_mean: Correlations with MACD_mean, Stochastic_mean, and Force_mean are less than 0.8.
MACD_mean: Correlations with STD_mean, EMA200_mean, EMA100_mean, EMA50_mean, Stochastic_mean, and Force_mean are less than 0.8.
Stochastic_mean: Correlations with STD_mean, EMA200_mean, EMA100_mean, and EMA50_mean are less than 0.8.
MOM_mean: Correlation with Force_mean is less than 0.8.
Force_mean: Correlations with STD_mean, EMA200_mean, EMA100_mean, EMA50_mean, MACD_mean, Stochastic_mean, and MOM_mean are less than 0.8.
CCI_mean: Correlations with STD_mean, MACD_mean, Force_mean, and Stochastic_mean are less than 0.8.
RSI_mean: Correlations with STD_mean and Force_mean are less than 0.8.
group: Has negligible correlations (close to 0) with all other features.


Selected Features:
EMA200_mean, EMA100_mean, EMA50_mean: These are highly correlated (above 0.8). We select EMA200_mean as a representative feature because it reflects longer-term trends, often more robust in financial modeling.
MOM_mean, WPR_mean, BB_mean: These features are strongly correlated. Select MOM_mean, as momentum is a widely used predictor in financial forecasting.

Features with Moderate or Weak Correlations:
MACD_mean: A key technical indicator for identifying trends and potential reversals, with correlations below 0.8 with EMA* and other features.
Stochastic_mean: Measures momentum and provides complementary information to MOM_mean.
Force_mean: Shows weak to moderate correlations with other features and can capture unique aspects of market activity.
CCI_mean: Measures deviations from a moving average and has correlations below 0.8 with other features.
RSI_mean: Provides insights into overbought or oversold conditions and has weak correlations with other features.
STD_mean: Though its correlations with other features are negligible, it could add unique information regarding price volatility.


##  Fitting Model 1 
Logistic Regression

```{r}
formula1 = tipo ~ RSI_mean + Stochastic_mean + EMA200_mean + STD_mean + MOM_mean + CCI_mean + MACD_mean + Force_mean 

prior1 <- set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b") + 
         set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "Intercept")
```

```{r}
 fit_model1 <- brm(
   formula = formula1,
   data = data,
   family = bernoulli(link = "logit"),
   prior = prior1,
   chains = 4, iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, cores = 4
 )
```



##  Fitting Model 2 
Hierarchical Logistic Regression:
Modeling Group-Specific Variability: Captures differences in the behavior of forex movements across trading hours/days.
Pooling Information Across Groups: Hierarchical models perform partial pooling, improving estimates in groups with sparse data.
Improved Generalization: By accounting for group-specific patterns, the model can generalize better to unseen data.
Interpretation of Random Effects: Quantifies the variability across groups, giving insights into the influence of temporal factors.

The feature "group" (a combination of Hour and DayOfWeek) can be considered a natural grouping factor because: 1. It aligns with temporal dependencies in forex trading, where market behavior varies by time and day. 2. Forex markets experience different levels of activity during different hours and days (e.g., higher activity during overlaps of major market sessions like London/New York).

In our case, grouping by Hour and DayOfWeek captures temporal structures. This grouping reflects the intuition that Forex markets behave differently based on the time of day or day of the week.

```{r}
formula2 = tipo ~ RSI_mean + Stochastic_mean + EMA200_mean + STD_mean + MOM_mean + CCI_mean + MACD_mean + Force_mean + (1 | group) # Random intercept by group

prior2 <- set_prior("normal(0, 1)", class = "b") + 
         set_prior("cauchy(0, 1)", class = "sd")
```

```{r}
  # Fit the hierarchical logistic regression model
  fit_model2 <- brm(
    formula = formula2,
    data = data,
    family = bernoulli(link = "logit"),  # Logistic regression
    prior = prior2,
    chains = 4, iter = 2000, warmup = 1000, cores = 4
  )
```
